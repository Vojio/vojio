## timeline highlights

i’m [markus](https://read.cv/markusm), an industrial-designer-turned digital product designer. the same eye for volumes, tolerances, and user flow now drives interfaces and systems that bridge digital and physical space. i build things that feel intuitive, unexpected, and thoughtful, and i’m always up for teaming with founders or anyone pushing bold ideas forward.

here’s what i’ve been building over the years:

*27yrs-now:*  
- built [shamir-secret-manager](https://github.com/vojio/shamir-secret-manager), a 500-line python cli for splitting and recovering seed phrases with shamir secret sharing  
- crafting [obliso](https://www.obliso.com/), a rust + swift macos/ios app for easy and secure n-of-k seed storage  
- prototyping [mondecai](https://mondec.ai/), a local-first ai that plays conversations via monte-carlo search, private beta  
- game creator + community scout at [rosebud.ai](https://rosebud.ai/), shipping touch-first games with generative pipelines  

*26yrs:*  
- shipped a minimal [bitcoin wallet demo](https://vojio-software.vercel.app/) with live data using [srcl](https://github.com/vojio/sacred-software) terminal ui components  
- designed and launched a jobs web-app for [scherer ingenieure](https://www.scherer-ingenieure.com/jobsuche) helping high-skill engineers find roles  
- spun up tooling and visual frameworks for micro ai products  
- explored brand systems for studios and solo builders  

*25yrs:*  
- product lead at scherer ingenieure, rebuilt the front-end for clarity, structure, and a unified visual language
- integrated deepseek in a website’s local-storage search using [onnx](https://huggingface.co/onnxruntime/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-ONNX)
- did LoRA training in flux and custom stable-diffusion safetensors
- built workflow dashboards and ux improvements that boosted team efficiency and pivoted toward resilient, behind-the-scenes systems over showcase pieces

*24yrs:*  
- designed the app and landing page for [photure](https://www.producthunt.com/products/photure), a p2p media platform minting uncensored nfts; team hit 30k downloads and raised \$765k at a \$5m cap  
- freelance at *the studio dao*, collaborating with a yc + techstars mentor on site and brand  
- wove ai-assisted flows deeper into my design stack  

*23yrs:*  
- 0→1 product design at [plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com); platform now voted [best browser extension](https://www.producthunt.com/categories/chrome-extensions) (producthunt 2024 + 2025) with 11.6k stars on [github](https://github.com/plasmohq/plasmo)
- built **pylearn**, a beginner-friendly coding app prototype  
- contributed to [constitution dao](https://www.constitutiondao.com/), a one-off dao that crowdfunded \$47m to bid on a u.s. constitution copy, where i built a high-traffic auction ui seen by thousands  
- freelance branding + ui/ux for **hdghog**, a decentralised exchange led by an early facebook novi founder  

*21–22yrs:*  
- designed, built, and oversaw fabrication of a [smart mushroom cultivation unit](https://germandesigngraduates.com/fertigungsgerechte-planung-einer-intelligenten-pilzkultivierungseinheit-production-oriented-planning-of-an-intelligent-mushroom-cultivation-unit/) for my bachelor’s thesis  
- produced cad visuals for an exhibition build for [sonnleitner](https://www.sonnleitner.de/), later realised at bau19 munich  

*19–21yrs:*  
- switched to industrial design to fuse spatial thinking with rapid prototyping  
- built and maintained [id-regensburg.de](https://id-regensburg.de), a showcase of standout student work  
- deepened systems thinking across ui/ux and digital-physical intersections  

*17–18yrs:*  
- declined an architecture place at [tum](https://www.tum.de/) after realising code iterates faster  
- became on of the earliest testflight testers for christian selig’s [apollo](https://apolloapp.io/), sending [feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/31cg5a/report_bugs/) that shipped in the reddit client used by millions  
- one year computer science: grasped coding basics, git, and algorithms  
- interned at [communiaсs](https://www.communiacs.de/), creating svg animations, wireframes, and visual concepts for e-commerce sites like [eterna](https://www.eterna.de/de/), [bavaria-yachts](https://www.bavariayachts.com/de-de/), and [knaus](https://www.knaus.com/de-de/wohnmobile/) that went live  

*14–16yrs:*  
- jailbreak enthusiast: dissected ios, installed cydia tweaks, debugged crashes, rolled back firmware  
- ran private minecraft and wow realms, managing plugins and small friend communities  
- shipped dozens of micro-sites and experiments (html, css, first js); all offline now, each sharpened my front-end instincts  

the faster everything accelerates, the more i care about clarity, friction, and form. i’m leaning in, blending design, code, and ai to build things no single role could fully define.
