*earlier:*  
- jailbreak enthusiast: dissected ios, installed cydia tweaks, debugged crashes, rolled back firmware  
- ran private minecraft and wow realms, managing plugins and small friend communities  
- built micro-sites and experiments (html, css, first js); all offline now, each sharpened my front-end instincts  

the faster everything accelerates, the more i care about clarity, friction, and form.
